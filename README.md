- 👋 Hi, I’m @jy379
- 👀 I’m interested in geometry, topology, analysis, probability, and statistics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Morse theory and Floer homology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the 2024 UIUC Statistics Datathon (though I already have a group).
- 📫 How to reach me - I am sometimes in my office in the basement of an old building near the bookstore on campus, with the cockroaches.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have not finished this PhD and I am already thinking of doing a second PhD.
